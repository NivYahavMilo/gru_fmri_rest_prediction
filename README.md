# gru_fmri_rest_prediction

The repository containing code and resources for predicting resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models. The project aims to leverage the power of GRU, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to model temporal dependencies in fMRI data during resting states. The repository provides implementations for training GRU models on fMRI datasets, along with utilities for data preprocessing and evaluation. The predicted fMRI responses can be utilized for various applications, including brain mapping, cognitive state classification, and understanding brain activity patterns during resting states. Researchers and practitioners interested in analyzing fMRI data with deep learning techniques will find this repository valuable for its flexible and extensible architecture."
